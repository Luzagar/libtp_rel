# Welcome to libtp_rel

Hi! This is a library written in **C/C++** specifically for **The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess**
This project is meant to be the backbone of your Twilight Princess mod by providing easy and quick access to a lot of functions, variables and data-fields used in the game.
It also features some basic tools and wrapper functions to avoid recreating the same code for future RELs.

# Usage
This project is meant to be used as a **Submodule**, you can check out [this template](//github.com/zsrtp/REL) repository.

Additionally, the function/variable names used in this project require the mangled names from the game's symbol maps. An easy way to extract these is to use [tplist](https://github.com/kipcode66/tplist), which was created by [kipcode66](https://github.com/kipcode66) for the sole purpose of extracting symbol entries to be used in **lst** files for REL projects.
