# Welcome to libtp_rel

Hi! This is a library written in **C/C++** specifically for **The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess**
This project is meant to be the backbone of your Twilight Princess mod by providing easy and quick access to a lot of functions, variables and data-fields used in the game.
It also features some basic tools and wrapper functions to avoid recreating the same code for future RELs
